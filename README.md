# Responsive-Hamburger-Menu-Right

A Mobile-first responsive hamburger menu on the right side for mobile devices. For tablets, laptops, and desktops, a regular menu is displayed on the right side. The hamburger menu can be opened and closed but there is no navigation to other pages or single site sections. This functionality has not been implemented. This project was created to get experience creating a hamburger menu on the right side of a mobile screen and was created using HTML, CSS and some basic JavaScript to open and close the menu.
